# Boom_Bike_Project

## Project Overview

Boom Bike bike-sharing demand prediction project using machine learning analysis and data classification. This project demonstrates advanced data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques to predict bike-sharing demand.

## Objective

To build a regression model that predicts the demand for bike-sharing services based on various environmental and temporal factors. The model helps optimize resource allocation and improve service availability.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bike-sharing patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation and selection of relevant features for demand prediction
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of multiple regression algorithms
- **Data Classification**: Segmentation of bike-sharing demand patterns
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics and model comparison

## Dataset

The dataset includes:
- Environmental factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather conditions)
- Temporal variables (day of week, month, season, holiday information)
- User categories (registered users, casual users)
- Historical demand data

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
